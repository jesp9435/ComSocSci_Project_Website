### We all know the iconic yellow taxicab from New York City. With more than 13,000 of these yellow taxis spread across five boroughs, we wanted to dwelve deeper into the underlying patters and trends within this taxi-network. More specifically, we wondered if the amount of rain has an effect on the amount tipped to the cap driver, as well as investigating from a textual analysis what factors could contribute to these patters.

> **The Dataset**:  
> The dataset consisted of three main parts; Taxi Trip Records, Weather Data, and Wikipedia Pages for each of the five boroughs.
